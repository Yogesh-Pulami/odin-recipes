    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Momos are made from a thin dough wrapper that is filled with a mixture of minced meat, vegetables, herbs, and spices. They are usually served with a sauce called achar, but can also be used in soups.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>minced meat</li>
        <li>onion</li>
        <li>chopped coriander</li>
        <li>ginger and garlic paste</li>
        <li>coriander powder</li>
        <li>turmeric</li>
        <li>cumin powder</li>
        <li>oil</li>
        <li>salt</li>
        <li>flour</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Step</h4>
<ol>
<li>Preparing the fillings</li><ul>
<li>Add 1 grated onion to the minced meat.</li>
       <li>Add half a tablespoon of turmeric powder. This is to add a bit of color to the meat.</li> 
       <li>To enhance the flavor of the filling add 2 tablespoon of salt.</li> 
        <li>Add 2 tablespoons of grated chilli. You can add a bit more if you want the momos to be spicy.</li>
        <li>Add 2 tablespoons of ginger and garlic paste each.</li>
        <li>Add half a tablespoon of coriander powder to make the filling taste a bit sour.</li>
        <li>Mix the spices with the meat.</li>
        <li>Add 2 tablespoons of vegetable oil and mix it again. The oil prevents the filling from getting too dry (Nepalese love momo with juicy fillings).</li>
       <li>Add finely chopped coriander.</li> 
        <li>Mix them well.</li>
</ul>
<li>Making the momo wrapper</li>
<ul>
<li> Put the flour into a bowl.</li>
    <li>MAdd water a little at a time to the flour to make dough.</li>
    <li>Knead the dough for a few more minutes. This makes the dough easier to use.</li>
    <li>Pinch off a bit of the dough (the amount depends on how big you want the wrapping to be).</li>
    <li>With a rolling pin roll the dough as thin as possible into circular shapes (don't make them too thin or too thick) the size of a glass.</li>
</ul>
<li>Cooking the momos</li>
<ul>
<li> Put around one tablespoon of the filling into the centre of the wrapping.</li>
    <li>Pinch one edge of the wrapping to the other edge then twist it.</li>
    <li>Keep doing this until the filling is covered (make sure the wrapping fully covers the filling otherwise the momos may break when steamed).</li>
    <li>Oil the bottom of the steamer. This prevents the momos from sticking.</li>
    <li>Put the momos in a systematic order so that they don't touch each other.</li>
    <li>Steam for 20 - 30 mins.</li>
</ul>
</ol>
